            "AI agents are software programs that can interact with their environment, collect data, and use that data to perform self-directed tasks that meet predetermined goals. They are autonomous entities that can make decisions and take actions to achieve specific goals, often with minimal human oversight. AI agents can be classified based on their behavior, environment, and number of interacting agents, and they can encompass a wide range of functions beyond natural language processing, including decision-making, problem-solving, interacting with external environments, and performing actions.\n",

            "There are different types of AI agents, including reflex agents, learning agents, and hybrid models. Reflex agents are simple agents that react to specific situations, while learning agents can learn from experience and adapt to new situations. Hybrid models combine different approaches to achieve advanced solutions.\n",
